# imgDL
Python script for downloading images

*imgDL* is a beginner-created python script for downloading images off given URLs. 

**Dependencies**
- requests
- beautifulsoup

**Supported URLs**
- [x] http://boards.4chan.org/*board*/thread/*threadnumber*/*threadname*
- [ ] reddit
- [x] universal (all img tags)

**Bugs**
- [ ] Universal mode only works sometimes, since different sides reference URLs in their img tags differently.
